    DOSidle V2.10 is a small update from DOSidle V2.00, Advanced Power
Management (APM) support is the only big difference between the two. Here,
you will find a quick list of the changes. For complete information, please
read DOSIDLE.TXT, the full documentation with FAQs, History and more.

DOSidle V2.10
-------------

    - Added -Apm command-line switch to enable special APM features for
      DOSidle to implement even better cooling than in DOSidle V2.00!!

    - Added automatic Intel Pentium, Pentium-MMX and IDT WinChip C6 "Auto HLT"
      feature enable for Protected-mode (special thanks to Martin Malik)!!

    - Added automatic Intel Pentium-MMX "Low Power on Auto HLT" feature
      enable for Protected-mode (special thanks to Martin Malik)!!

    - Removed the -Tm switch (as in DOSidle V2.00 and earlier), which was not
      needed by general users, to shrink program size!!

    - Fixed a little bug in DOSidle V2.00 that was causing performance drop-
      down under MS-DOS V7.00+, when Windows95/98 was not loaded (when the
      system was restarted in MS-DOS mode from Windows95/98)!!

    - More bugfixes, as usual.



DOSidle V2.00
-------------

    - Recoded and optimized the WHOLE kernel for better performance, more
      features and easy future development (this is actually much more
      important than it sounds)!!

    - Added more powerful cooling routines to GREATLY ENHANCE performance!!
      Using the -Fm2, -Fm1, -Fm0 command-line switches you can now control
      DOSidle's cooling strategy directly!!

    - Added -On, -Off command-line switches to Activate and Suspend DOSidle
      at any time for a while, without removing it from memory!!

    - Added -Cpu command-line switch to Optimize the CPU!!

    - Added automatic CPU, Operating System and Protected Mode detection!!

    - Added automatic Cyrix/IBM/SGS Thomson 5x86, 6x86, 6x86L and 6x86MX
      "Suspend on HLT" feature enable!!

    - Added automatic Intel Pentium, Pentium-MMX and IDT WinChip C6 "Auto HLT"
      feature enable (Real-mode only)!!

    - Added automatic Intel Pentium-MMX "Low Power on Auto HLT" feature
      enable (Real-mode only)!!

    - Changed the command-line switch character from "/" to "-"!!
