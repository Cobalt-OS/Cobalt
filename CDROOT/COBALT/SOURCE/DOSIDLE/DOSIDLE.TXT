1   - DESCRIPTION.
======================


1.1 - What is DOSidle?
----------------------

    CPUidle for DOS (nicknamed DOSidle) is an MS-DOS based program that will
take advantage of the integrated power saving features of the microprocessor
and create an idle cycle in order to LOWER CPU TEMPERATURE CONSIDERABLY!

    DOSidle will also detect and enable integrated fine tuning features of
the processor to enhance the cache policy, enable 32-bit memory access where
possible, unlock some bus cycles, and more, so as to ACHIEVE HIGHER PROCESSOR
EXECUTION SPEED!

    The above are achieved by programming the microprocessor at register
level, accessing special internal configuration registers of the CPU. These
registers can be set up for very efficient power saving and execution speed.
This should be done by the BIOS of the computer, but unfortunately, most BIOS
vendors do a poor job in optimizing CPUs. Therefore, an external program
like DOSidle CAN actually cause a big change.
    DOSidle will also put the CPU in suspend mode when it is in an "idle"
state. Waiting for user input via the keyboard/mouse is a typical idle
situation and this is true about 95% of the time.
    In suspend mode, the CPU consumes A LOT LESS power than it normally would.
What is more, the processor returns from suspend mode automatically, by
hardware, thus the whole switch to and from suspend mode does not have an
impact on performance.
    Placing the processor in suspend mode is achieved by eighter executing
the HLT machine instruction or by calling the APM BIOS of the system. Of
course, accessing the APM BIOS is only possible when it exists...
    Again, this whole thing is TOTALLY HARMLESS as it executes instructions
that any other software can and does!



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 - DOSidle highlights.
-------------------------

    - Automatically detects processors from Cyrix, IBM, SGS Thomson, Intel,
      AMD, IDT, UMC and NexGen.

    - Optimizes and automatically enables special power saving features of
      the Pentium, Pentium-MMX, Pentium II, 5x86, 6x86, 6x86L, 6x86MX, K5,
      K6-MMX, K6-3D, K6-Plus, WinChip C6, WinChip C6-Plus.

      For a complete list of supported processors, please refer to section 3
      of this document.

    - 100% ASSEMBLY coded, therefore program should be both fast and small
      (the resident part of DOSidle is less than 3K).

    - Supports the Advanced Power Management specification V1.00 and above.

    - Powerful and flexible command-line interface allowing control of many
      features of DOSidle, including more aggressive cooling routines,
      self-debugging routines and more...

    - Can be suspended and activated any time after installation for maximum
      compatibility with other software.

    - Works with a wide range of program's and thus it cools the CPU reliably.
      This results in a more stable system and it expands CPU lifetime.

    - It's A MUST HAVE for overclockers! Stop thinking big fans, huge heat
      sinks and Peltiers, just think DOSidle! ;-)


    * To find out more about the differences between V2.10 and V2.00, please
      read the History section (and then the whole file :-).



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 - Usage.
------------

    DOSidle is a memory resident (TSR, for short) program, which needs to be
started only once, each time you restart your computer. Therefore, starting
DOSidle from AUTOEXEC.BAT is the preferred and recommended method. This has
the following advantages:

    - It is done automatically, so you won't ever have to bother with it once
      you installed DOSidle.

    - Upon startup, only a limited number of drivers are installed (I am
      mainly talking about protected mode drivers) and DOSidle has better
      access to the CPU registers.

    DOSidle is designed to operate under MS-DOS. Since Windows95 appeared,
the term "DOS" became a bit confusing. I will try to make this more clear now.
Basically, Windows95/98 uses MS-DOS pretty much the same way Windows 3.1 did.
The difference is that Windows95/98 starts up automatically, hiding the good
old MS-DOS interface from the user. But if you examine your C:\ directory you
will find that Windows95/98 also has its AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS, in fact,
the whole MS-DOS kernel exists (often referred to as MS-DOS 7.00) and loads
BEFORE Windows95/98 does.
    So the term "DOS" can be used whenever the following situations are in
effect:

    - MS-DOS 6.22 and earlier.
      Even if you have Windows 3.1 installed over it.

    - MS-DOS 7.00 and later.
      This is the DOS that Windows95/98 is built upon. It loads automatically
      before Windows does and it is there the whole time Windows runs!

      You can exclusively enter into this MS-DOS mode by eighter opening an
      MS-DOS Box from Windows95/98 or by restarting your computer in MS-DOS
      mode from the Start menu.

    DOSidle should be used in all of the above cases. Since Windows95/98 sits
on top of MS-DOS 7.00 (or later), it is NOT ENOUGH to use Andreas Goetz's
CpuIdle (unless you never-ever open an MS-DOS Box or restart in MS-DOS mode)!
    DOSidle will NOT conflict with CpuIdle, so if you have CpuIdle loaded in
Windows95/98 and open an MS-DOS Box with DOSidle loaded, you are doing
exactly what you should do!!

NOTE:   DOSidle will perform best under Real-mode CPU operation, or in other
        words, when no Memory Manager (such as EMM386) is active. But V86-mode
        (with EMM386) should be about as good...



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 - Installation.
-------------------

Setup:  Unzip the DOSIDLE.ZIP package into a directory of your choice. Place
        a line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file that will load DOSidle with the
        switches you prefer and reboot your computer.

        If you have multiple Operating Systems installed (Windows 3.1,
        Windows95/98, Windows NT, MS-DOS), then make sure the above line is
        placed in ALL AUTOEXEC files.

        If you are not exactly sure what the paragraph above means, please
        read on...


Step 1: Unzip the DOSIDLE.ZIP package into a directory you prefer. In the
        later examples, I will assume you have chosen the C:\DOSIDLE
        directory.

Step 2: If you know DOSidle well and/or decided to use it regularly, please
        go to Step 4.

        If you are completely new to DOSidle and haven't read this document
        then I strongly suggest doing so. Once you are finished, come back
        here.

Step 3: You are new to DOSidle. Experiment with it. You can install DOSidle
        anytime by typing "DOSidle" at the DOS command prompt (even in a
        Windows MS-DOS Box).

        NOTE: If you try to load DOSidle from a Windows95/98 DOS Box, then
        Windows95/98 displays a warning message saying that DOSidle may not
        run well, unless in MS-DOS mode. Answer NO to the question and you
        are done.

Step 4: You have decided to use DOSidle regularly. DOSidle should be loaded
        from your AUTOEXEC.BAT, this way, you won't have to bother with it
        each time you restart your computer.

        Windows95/98 has it's own AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Also, MS-DOS 6.22 (and
        earlier) has it's AUTOEXEC.BAT. If you have BOTH of these Operating
        Systems installed, then you will need to include a line in both of
        the AUTOEXEC.BAT files that will load DOSidle
        (later example: C:\DOSIDLE\DOSIDLE).

Step 5: If you are using some sort of a boot manager (like System Commander),
        I assume you know how to find and edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file(s) - 
        please go to Step 7.

        If you are unsure about these files, I would suggest the following
        steps:

Step 6: Locate the AUTOEXEC.BAT file(s). They should reside in the root
        directory of drive C. That is C:\

        Look for the following files: AUTOEXEC.BAT, AUTOEXEC.DOS,
        AUTOEXEC.W40, AUTOEXEC.W41  If you find any of these files, just
        include a line somewhere at the end like this (Optionally specifying
        command-line parameters. They are described in detail in the next
        section.):

        C:\DOSIDLE\DOSIDLE

Step 7: Restart your computer, and voila:
        DOSidle is resident now. You can check it to make sure using the
        "mem /c /p" command at the DOS prompt. If you find DOSidle in the
        list of resident drivers, it's installed!



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2   - DOSidle FEATURES.
===========================


2.1 - DOSidle features.
-----------------------

Cooling methods:
----------------

    DOSidle supports two ways of processor power management (later referred
to as cooling methods): through the HLT instruction or through APM BIOS calls.

    The HLT method means executing the HLT opcode each time DOSidle detects
that the system is idle. Since most processor enter suspend mode after a HLT
is executed, this method is very useful for power management.

    The APM BIOS calls method means invoking the "CPU idle" APM call each
time the system is detected idle. It is then up to the APM BIOS vendor how
efficient this call will be.



Cooling strategies:
-------------------

    Both power management methods can use three "strategies" to achieve
cooling: Strong Force mode, Normal Force mode and No Force mode.

    Strong Force mode is the most aggressive method, which can cause some
incompatibilities, but it is also by far the most efficient method. Running
in this mode, DOSidle intercepts more system calls as "idle", and it issues
multiple power saving calls (HLT or APM BIOS calls) from each idle cycle.

    Normal Force mode behaves pretty much the same way as Strong Force mode,
except that only 1 power saving call will be executed from each idle cycle,
so the cooling ratio is 1:1.

    No Force mode disabled forcing of power saving calls, only the most
obvious system functions (like Read Key or similar) will be intercepted and
treated as idle. The cooling ratio is the worst, but this mode should be very
compatible. Anyway, I am definately against using this strategy.



CPU optimization:
-----------------

    DOSidle will optimize the Central Processing Unit of the system if it is
requested. To find out more about optimizations, please read the Processors
section.



Command-line:
-------------

    DOSidle is configured from the command-line. All characteristics of
DOSidle can be controlled this way. To find out more about the command-line
switches, please read the next section.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 - Command-line options.
---------------------------

    DOSidle supports various command-line switches that control how the
program behaves. All switches are case-insensitive (so "-cpu" = "-Cpu") and
they are as follows:

Switches:
---------

-H, -?:
Displays a help message about command-line options, as well as some examples.

-U:
Uninstalls DOSidle (removes it from memory).
Of course, this is only possible, if it has been installed already. If not,
DOSidle will fail with an error message. Also, if some other program altered
the interrupt vectors that DOSidle uses it won't be able to uninstall.

NOTE:   The changing of critical interrupt vectors is a problem for any
        memory resident program that wants to uninstall. Therefore, the
        higher number of programs you use after DOSidle has been loaded, the
        higher the chances that DOSidle won't be able to uninstall (else the
        system would crash). In this case, use the -Off switch.

-Off:
Suspends DOSidle.
Use this switch if DOSidle conflicts with a certain application you are using.
All features of DOSidle will be turned off as well as the program itself, but
it will remain installed (in memory). Then when you finish using that
application you can reactivate DOSidle with the -On switch.

-On:
Reactivates DOSidle after it has been suspended with the -Off switch.
Read the paragraph above to find out why this is useful.

-Cpu:
Detects and optimizes the processor in the system.
Currently, processors from Cyrix/IBM/SGS Thomson are optimized, but AMD, IDT
and Intel processors will be supported in the near future as well. Please
read the CPU Optimization section for more information.

-Hlt:
Selects cooling method: HLT instructions.
This switch causes DOSidle to execute HLT instructions every time it detects
that the system is idle. Since most processors have a "Suspend on HLT"
feature, this instruction places them in suspend mode, thus saving energy and
achieving very good cooling.
This switch is enabled by default.

-Apm:
Selects cooling method: APM V1.00+ BIOS calls.
This switch makes DOSidle use the Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS in the
system for cooling. That is, APM calls (to put the CPU in suspend mode) will
be executed every time DOSidle detects that the system is idle. This yields
to superb cooling.

NOTE:   DOSidle will automatically switch to HLT cooling method (-Hlt) if the
        APM BIOS is somehow inaccessible (disabled or disengaged). It will
        not turn on power management, that should be done by the user from
        the system setup.

-Fm2:
Selects cooling strategy: Strong Force mode.
This switch makes DOSidle perform the most aggressive cooling strategy, which
means better cooling ratio (several HLTs / APM calls will be made from each
idle cycle). On the other hand, this might cause some incompatibilities, but
it is highly unlikely.
This switch is enabled by default and I definately recommend using it!

-Fm1:
Selects cooling strategy: Normal Force mode.
This switch makes DOSidle use the cooling strategy that was introduced in
DOSidle V1.32 [Beta]. The cooling ratio is 1:1, which means that exactly one
HLT instruction / APM call will be made from each idle cycle. This means
worse cooling than Strong Force mode (above paragraph), but should be more
compatible.
This switch is disabled by default, and it should only be enabled if Strong
Force mode is causing strange behaviour.

-Fm0:
Selects cooling strategy: No Force mode.
This switch disables any type of HLT / APM call forcing from idle cycles and
therefore performance is very little. On the other hand, No Force mode should
be compatible with every program.
For the sake of performance, do not select this strategy for cooling!! Only
use this switch if everything else fails.

-Tm:
Enables Test Mode. REMOVED!
The -Tm switch is removed from DOSidle V2.10 and later! It was used to
display information about the cooling ratio and the number of HLTs / APM calls
executed, mainly for Beta testers.



Examples:
---------

DOSidle
Installs and activates DOSidle. Selects HLT cooling method with Strong Force
mode (-Fm2) strategy. This means that the following switches are enabled by
default: -On, -Hlt, -Fm2.


DOSidle -cpu
Installs and activates DOSidle. Selects HLT cooling method with Strong Force
mode strategy. Optimizes the CPU of the system.
I recommend loading DOSidle this way!


DOSidle -cpu -apm -fm1
Installs and activates DOSidle. Selects APM BIOS calls cooling method with
Normal Force mode strategy. Optimizes the CPU of the system.


DOSidle -off
Suspends DOSidle temporarily, until you type: DOSidle -on



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3   - PROCESSORS.
=====================

3.1 - CPU detection.
--------------------

    DOSidle automatically detects the CPU in the system and enables special
power saving features of the processor. Please note that even if DOSidle
misidentifies your CPU, it will run at full cooling performance, only CPU
optimization will not function. The following CPUs are detected and
supported by DOSidle:

Intel:
- i486DX at 25/33 Mhz, i486DX at 50 Mhz.
- i486 SX / SX2 / SL / DX2 / DX2-WB / DX4 / DX4-WB.
- Pentium A-Step, Pentium, Pentium OverDrive, Pentium-MMX,
  Pentium Pro A-Step, Pentium Pro, Pentium II.


AMD:
- Am486 DX2 / DX2-WB / DX4 / DX4-WB.
- Am5x86, Am5x86-WB.
- AMD K5-SS/A, AMD K5, AMD K6-MMX, AMD K6-3D, AMD K6-Plus.

All future AMD processors will be detected due to AMD's support for the
Extended CPUID instruction.


Cyrix:
- Cx486S A-Step.
- Cx486 SLC / DLC / SLC2 / DLC2 / SRx / DRx / SRx2 / DRx2 / SRu / DRu / SRu2

- Cx5x86, Cx6x86, Cx6x86L, Cx6x86MX.
- Cx MediaGX, Cx GXm.

All future Cyrix processors will be detected due to Cyrix's support for the
Extended CPUID instruction.


NexGen:
- Nx586, Nx586 & Nx587, Nx686.


IBM:
- IBM 5x86, IBM 6x86, IBM 6x86L, IBM 6x86MX.

- IDT WinChip C6, IDT WinChip C6-Plus.


UMC:
- UMC U5D, UMC U5S.


Thomson:
- SGS Thomson 6x86, SGS Thomson 6x86L.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 - CPU features.
-------------------

    Many CPUs support special power saving functions. Taking advantage of
these integrated features is critical in efficient CPU power management.
DOSidle can and does enable the following features on certain CPUs:

Suspend on HLT:
- AMD K5-SS/A, AMD K5, AMD K6-MMX, AMD K6-3D, AMD K6-Plus.
- IBM 5x86, IBM 6x86, IBM 6x86L, IBM 6x86MX.
- Cx5x86, Cx6x86, Cx6x86L, Cx6x86MX.
- SGS Thomson 6x86, SGS Thomson 6x86L.

Auto HLT:
- Intel Pentium, Pentium-MMX.
- IDT WinChip C6, IDT WinChip C6-Plus.

Low Power on Auto HLT:
- Pentium-MMX.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 - CPU optimization.
-----------------------

    With V2.00+, CPU detecting and optimizing features have been added to
DOSidle. DOSidle will now automatically detect to CPU in the system and
optionally (if you select it with the -cpu switch) optimize it.
    CPU optimization may cause some system instabilities, only experiment
with it once you are sure that everything else is stable. If something goes
wrong afterwards, you can be sure that the CPU optimization is the cause.

    The following CPUs are optimized:

CPUs from Cyrix
---------------
Cyrix 5x86      - Suspend on HLT, CPUID.
Cyrix 6x86      - Suspend on HLT, CPUID, Weak Locking, Write Allocate.
Cyrix 6x86L     - Suspend on HLT, CPUID, Weak Locking, Write Allocate.
Cyrix 6x86MX    - Suspend on HLT, CPUID, Weak Locking, Write Allocate.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================

5.1 - Frequently Asked Questions.
---------------------------------

Q: So what the heck is this program??

A: DOSidle is a program that will take advantage of the power management
   features of your microprocessor so as to reduce heat buildup.
   Windows95/98 and MS-DOS does not support these features, therefore a lot
   of heat is generated unnecessarily when the system is idle (waiting for
   user input).
   Several measurements indicate that DOSidle can even cause a 16 C degrees
   (29 F degrees) temperature drop. Many good heatsinks and fans would envy
   this :)



Q: I already have CpuIdle from Andreas Goetz, why would I want to use DOSidle?

A: Simple. CpuIdle does a superb job in cooling the system under Windows95/98.
   On the other hand, DOSidle does a great job (hopefully) in cooling the
   system under MS-DOS 6.22 and earlier, MS-DOS 7.00 and later (Windows95/98
   MS-DOS) AND in a Window95/98 MS-DOS Box.
   Since users of Windows95/98 generally use MS-DOS in one of the above ways,
   DOSidle is needed to reduce heat just as CpuIdle does in pure Windows95/98.



Q: I know CpuIdle quite well and I have observed that it can cause a
   temperature drop of 20 C degrees. How come DOSidle sometimes achieves
   better, but sometimes worse performance?

A: MS-DOS is a lot different story from Windows95/98. Whereas the Windows
   operating system handles idle threads quite naturally (and thus it's easier
   to know when the system is idle), MS-DOS is a place of total chaos. There
   is NO standard way of user I/O, therefore DOSidle must make a lot of
   assumptions. These assumptions are sometimes correct and the cooling is
   highly efficient, but sometimes wrong and cooling performance drops.
   And of course, if a program manages its I/O in a quirky behaviour, DOSidle
   is tricked and it won't be able to cool effectively. Believe me, DOSidle
   does EVERYTHING that is possible under MS-DOS!



Q: Will DOSidle slow my system in some way?

A: No, no and NO! It definately shouldn't. If you notice program slowdown
   that is caused by DOSidle, please report it to me immediately!



Q: Can DOSidle damage my CPU?

A: NO!!



Q: Can I have the assembly source code of DOSidle?

A: If you pay for it... maybe. Otherwise no.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 - Final words.
------------------

    If anybody knows how to execute CPL0 (Ring 0) instructions under DPMI 0.9
or DPMI 1.0, please let me know right away!! Also, I would greatly appreciate
any feedback regarding DOSidle: notes, ideas, comments, bugs or any E-mail
for any reason. Your opinion is the most important to me, but I will never
know it unless I hear (or read) it :).

I would like to thank Andi (Andreas Goetz) for his help and support, Martin
Malik (author of HWiNFO) for his source code, and Zsuzsi (Zsuzsa Petro) for
her patience in first place.

Many thanks go to the Beta testers of DOSidle as well. They are:
- David Szots
- Vito DeFilippo
- and finally, Andi and myself...
