                          3. FEATURES INCLUDED

This RAM disk currently supports the following features:

  * Compatible with MS-DOS versions from 3 to 7 and DR-DOS 5 to 6.
  * XMS - Extended memory on 286 and up with HIMEM or other XMS 2.0
    driver.
  * EMS - Expanded memory of LIM/EMS version 3.2 and 4.0.
  * Device drivers may be chained to form larger disks using many
    different kind memories.
  * Resizeable - can preserve disk contents if new format has room 
    enough.
  * Removable. Can be disabled without reboot.
  * Supports 32-bit sector addressing introduced in DOS 4. Thus over 32M
    RAM disks are possible if you have the memory.
  * Configurable
      - sector size
      - cluster size
      - root directory entry count
      - number of FATs
  * Predefined DOS and FDFORMAT floppy disk look-alike formats.
  * DISKCOPY compatible with DOS versions from 3.20 up. You can copy
    to/from SRDISK drive using DOS DISKCOPY.
  * Write protection.
  * Can optionally set environment variables SRDISKn (n=1,2,...) to
    the installed SRDISK drive letters.
  * Comes with a dummy drive you can use to locate SRDISK (or any other 
    installable) drive at a higher letter.

I have a list of new features to implement in the future. By sending 
money and feature suggestions you can help me make this program still 
better.

Users may find that the ability to resize is invaluable. Since some 
programs can take best use of memory by directly using it while others 
need a fast disk for temporary files, you can now have optimal 
performance with both kinds of programs without the trouble of changing 
configuration and rebooting.

The feature of being able to resize automagically when there is need for 
it is currently not in my reach. FAT file system in DOS just was not 
designed for it. There is some more explanation about it later in this 
document.

The small versions of device drivers do not support DOS DISKCOPY 
compatibility and may require user to make sure there is enough stack 
available by specifying STACKS=8,512 (or similar) in CONFIG.SYS. Also, 
you can not chain another device driver after a small version device 
driver.



                                5. USAGE

The SRDISK is basically split into two parts:

        1) a device driver to add the virtual drive into DOS and
        2) a program to control the device driver

The following explains the installation and how to use both of these
parts.


                        5.1. BASIC INSTALLATION

The basic installation for XMS memory can be done following these steps:

1. Copy SRDXMS.SYS into you root directory.

2. Copy SRDISK.EXE into some directory in your PATH.

3. Make sure you have HIMEM.SYS or some other XMS driver installed
   in CONFIG.SYS before the following step.

4. Add into your CONFIG.SYS line

        DEVICE=SRDXMS.SYS

5. Add into your AUTOEXEC.BAT after the PATH command line

        SRDISK <size>

The <size> defines the disk size in Kbytes.

If you have EMS memory, then use file SRDEMS.SYS in place of SRDXMS.SYS 
and make sure EMS 4.0 device driver is installed in CONFIG.SYS before 
the SRDEMS.SYS.

The device driver adds into DOS a new disk drive. Before you run
SRDISK.EXE or when you set the disk size to zero, the new disk drive
behaves as if you have a floppy drive without a floppy inserted.


                       5.2. SRDISK DEVICE DRIVER

For a RAM disk you need a device driver. This device driver supplies a 
storage for an array of sectors which DOS uses to store all the data. 
SRDISK comes with separate drivers for storing the sectors in XMS 
(extended memory managed by HIMEM.SYS or other XMS driver) and in EMS 
memory.

Most often you do not need any parameters for the device drivers, but 
the driver accepts two parameters:

        DEVICE=SRDmmm.SYS [d:] [/A]

The [] around the parameter mean it is optional; you must not type the
brackets.

d:      The 'd:' can be used to tell the driver at what letter it is 
        assigned in case DOS does not let it know it.

        Another use for 'd:' is to define into what SRDISK drive the 
        current driver is to be appended.

        If you need to have SRDISK at some specific drive letter, you 
        can use SRDUMMY.SYS. Note though, that drive letters are always 
        used in order from A to Z and you can only use up a few drives 
        before the letter you want to use.

/A      This tells the driver to append itself to the previously 
        installed SRDISK device driver. The memory accessed using this 
        driver is then available as extra memory to the previously 
        installed SRDISK drive.

        If you want the low part of your disk to use XMS and the high 
        part EMS memory, you can put these two lines into your 
        CONFIG.SYS

                DEVICE=SRDXMS.SYS
                DEVICE=SRDEMS.SYS /A

        For this to work, the first device driver must have the extra 
        code to look into the next driver for more memory. Therefore the 
        first device driver must not be the small version SRDXMSS.SYS or 
        SRDEMSS.SYS.

Merely installing the driver gives you no RAM disk. It is as if you had 
installed a floppy drive without putting a disk in the drive. For that 
you need the SRDISK.EXE program.

The following chapters give some explanation about the different memory 
types and explains reasons for the problems there are.


                    5.2.1. XMS MEMORY DEVICE DRIVER

8088 processor instruction set can only access memory at addresses from 
0 to 1048575 (1 megabyte) and memory above the address 1048575 is called 
extended memory. i80286 had a new mode (protected mode) where the 
instructions had a little different meanings and could be used to 
address memory above the 1 megabyte limit.

XMS (eXtended Memory Specification) is a means to control the usage of 
extended memory between applications so that each application can have 
exclusive access to some range of addresses without fear the other 
application would be using the same memory for its own purposes.

When SRDISK (or any other XMS client) needs extended memory, it requests 
it from extended memory manager (EMM) that follows the eXtended Memory 
Specification. Most common and free such memory manager is HIMEM.SYS.

The EMM then tries to find available memory block (a contiguous range of 
addresses available) that is as large or larger than the requested 
memory block. If all of the available blocks are smaller than the 
requested size, the request fails even if the available blocks would be 
large enough when combined.

Since DOS and DOS programs still run in the 8088 mode where instructions 
can not address memory beyond 1 megabyte limit, there is no way for them 
to access the memory directly. XMS also defines service to copy memory 
to and from the memory beyond the 1 megabyte limit.


                    5.2.2. EMS MEMORY DEVICE DRIVER

Since 8088 could only address memory up to 1 megabyte, any memory added 
had to be made to use the same addresses with already existing memory. 
Some new hardware had to be added so that the memory occupying a range 
of addresses could be switched with another block of memory. 
Lotus/Intel/MicroSoft Expanded Memory Specification (LIM EMS) was 
developed to provide standardized access to this memory for much the 
same reason XMS was developed to provide access to extended memory.

EMS uses a 64K memory area divided into four separate 16K windows to 
access the expanded memory. These windows show different 16K blocks of 
EMS memory (called pages) as requested by the application.

EMS memory can also be simulated very efficiently with 386 virtual 
memory. For example EMM386 uses this method to convert extended memory 
into expanded memory.

Since EMS memory is consisted of separate 16K pages, there is no 
requirement to have the allocated memory be in contiguous blocks as with 
XMS memory. Since all the available memory can be allocated, you can 
better predict how much memory you can allocate.


                    5.2.3. EMS 3.2 MEMORY DEVICE DRIVER

EMS 3.2 is an older version of EMS. 4.0 is the currently most used one.

The main reason SRDISK has version 3.2 driver is that MS-Windows 3.1 has 
a serious bug in the EMS protection it uses. Basically with the EMS 3.2 
driver you can access EMS disk that has been allocated before starting 
MS-Windows but not one that is allocated inside DOS window. With the EMS 
4.0 driver you can not access memory allocated before starting 
MS-Windows but can well access memory that is allocated inside DOS 
window.

In any case, MS-Windows will not allow any other process access the 
disk allocated in another process.


                       5.3. SRDUMMY DEVICE DRIVER

SRDUMMY.SYS can be used to force installable device drivers to some 
specific drive letters. To better understand what for you might need it, 
read the following paragraph.

DOS allocates drives in order from A to Z. The first drives A and B are 
always used for floppy drives. If you have hard disks, drives from C up 
are allocated to them by DOS before CONFIG.SYS is loaded. After all the 
standard hardware drives have been assigned, DOS reads the CONFIG.SYS 
and loads the devices found there. Each block device driver (a device 
supplying only an array of blocks of data, like SRDISK) is assigned one 
or more drive letters in the order they are in CONFIG.SYS. The device 
drivers can not determine to which drives they get assigned.

SRDUMMY.SYS tells DOS it provides one or more block devices and thus 
uses up some drive letters. There will not be any drives though, and if 
you access the drives, you'll get the drive not ready error.

SRDUMMY.SYS takes one parameter: The drive letter the next block device 
should be loaded to.

Take a look at the following sample CONFIG.SYS:

        DEVICE=SRDXMS.SYS
        DEVICE=SRDUMMY.SYS G:
        DEVICE=SRDEMS.SYS

If you have one hard disk, the floppies and hard disk use letters A-C. 
SRDXMS.SYS is then loaded to D and SRDUMMY.SYS uses drives E and F.
SRDEMS.SYS loads thus at G.

If you add a second hard drive, it will take drive letter D and 
SRDXMS.SYS will then be at E and SRDUMMY.SYS use only drive F putting
SRDEMS.SYS to G again.

If you add a few more drives so that drive G is already in use before 
SRDUMMY.SYS gets loaded, you will only get a warning message from 
SRDUMMY.SYS and the SRDEMS.SYS will load at the next available drive 
letter.

Unfortunately, this does not help if you have a CD-ROM installed and
want to install SRDISK to a different drive letter. MSCDEX will not
install to a drive letter already used by SRDUMMY no more than it
installs to a drive used by SRDISK.

DR-DOS 6 seems not to allow access to drive letters after P: even with 
LASTDRIVE=Z statement in CONFIG.SYS. So with DR-DOS you must avoid using 
the last drive letters after P:.


                          5.4. SRDISK PROGRAM

The disk can be enabled by, for example, using command "SRDISK 1024"
which will make first SRDISK a 1024K disk. It can be disabled by making
it of size 0: "SRDISK 0".

You should include the command to enable the RAM disk into your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The SRDISK.EXE is self documented. You'll get the documentation by
typing at the DOS prompt "SRDISK /?" and hitting enter. To get a hang of
it better, some examples with explanations are given below.


                     5.4.1. SRDISK SAMPLE COMMANDS

Command

        SRDISK 1024

creates or changes the old disk to a 1024K (= 1M) disk.

More precisely it calculates various disk parameters as it best sees fit
for most users needs. Those disk parameters can be defined by user on
the command line if the calculated values do not meet his needs. After
the parameters have been calculated, the memory (1024K = 1M) needed for
the disk is allocated and a disk image is created into the memory.

The calculated parameters include sector size, cluster size, number of
FATs and root directory size.

- Sector is the basic unit of storage. It's size does not mean much, but
  it has to be a power of 2 and no larger than 512 bytes.

- Cluster size tells in how large blocks the space is allocated. Larger
  clusters mean smaller FAT (= File Allocation Table), but then even the
  smallest file always takes at least that much space. Cluster can not
  be smaller than one sector. A cluster is a collection of sectors.

- FAT is the table that holds information about each allocation unit,
  cluster, on the disk. The information can be indication that the
  cluster is free, or where the next cluster of the file is or that the
  cluster is unusable. A disk only needs one FAT - though multiple
  copies of it can be specified. Note that the other FATs are only
  copies of the first one.

- Root directory is limited to hold only some predefined number of
  files. If you get "Can not create file" errors while there is plenty
  of free space on disk, you need to make the root directory larger.
  Alternatively you should create a subdirectory and create the files
  there. Subdirectories can be arbitrarily large.

If there is data on the disk to be preserved, sector and cluster size 
are not changed.

Command

        SRDISK 1024 /O

does the same as the command 'SRDISK 1024' except the various disk
parameters are not calculated but instead the old parameters are used.

Command

        SRDISK /F:1440

tries to create the disk to look like a real floppy disk. It also 
defines some parameters that otherwise have no effect like media 
descriptor, number of heads and sectors per track. These parameters have 
no other function but to make it look like it is a real, physical disk - 
which it is not. SRDISK drives are not accessible through BIOS, so some 
diskcopy and utility programs can fail if used with SRDISK.

Command

        SRDISK /S:256 /C:1024 /D:64

reformats the disk. The size is determined by the old size of the disk
even without the use of /O. Sector size is changed to 256 bytes, cluster
size to 1024 bytes (two sectors) and root directory will hold 64 entries
(one of which is used for the volume label).

Command

        SRDISK /U

clears the disk. It recalculates the format and makes it better if 
possible, but preserves the disk size. Without this switch, the disk 
contents are preserved if possible. This is also useful if you can not 
resize the disk because of errors on it -- using this option the errors 
will be ignored and the disk is made whole new.

Command

        SRDISK E:

tests if E is a SRDISK RAMDisk and, as no format is defined, display
it's current configuration. The letter may not correspond to the letter
known by DOS for the drive if the letter is defined wrong when
installing the SRDISK.SYS device driver in CONFIG.SYS.

Command

        SRDISK

without the drive letter specified tries to determine the drive by first
trying the current drive and if it is not a SRDISK drive, then the first
SRDISK drive loaded in CONFIG.SYS. As no change in the format is
defined, the current configuration of the found drive are displayed.


                   5.4.2. SRDISK COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

To ease remembering the command line options, SRDISK has for some 
settings several different options. Many of the options are long, but 
you can truncate them if you write enough for SRDISK to identify the 
option unambiguously.

An exact match in the full length of the option is always identified 
instead of some another option that begins with the same characters.

All numeric parameters for the options are translated using the C 
language rules: Number starting with 0 is octal number (base eight) and 
with 0x is hexadecimal (base 16), others are decimal.

The options in alphabetical order are

The options by function

  /? /H /HELP

        List the most important command line options and exit.

  /A:n /FATS:n

        Number of FAT copies (1 or 2). You need only one FAT unless you 
        need to make the disk look like some floppy disk.

  /AVAILABLE:n /MINSIZE

        Space available on the disk. The disk size will be counted to be 
        large enough to hold the files already on it and to have n 
        Kbytes of space available.

        /MINSIZE is the same as /AVAILABLE:0 and will also make the root 
        directory smaller.

  /BOOTSECTOR:file

        You might be interested in a special boot sector if you are
        preparing a disk to be copied to a real floppy. SRDISK provides
        a working boot sector, so this is not necessary but in a very
        special situation.

  /C:n /CLUSTER:n

        Cluster size. Cluster is the unit used to allocate disk space.
        This option has effect on the space used for File Allocation 
        Table. If cluster size is small, bigger FAT is needed and there 
        is less room for files, but files may take more room.

  /D:n /DIRENTRIES:n

        Root directory entries. FAT file system has fixed size root 
        directory. You can specify the size for it using this option.

        Note that each entry is 32 bytes long and a fixed amount of 
        sectors are used to hold the entries. Thus if sector size is 512 
        bytes each sector can hold 16 entries (512 / 32 = 16) and 
        specifying /D:4 or /D:16 uses exactly the same amount of space 
        on the disk: one sector.

        If there is nothing against it, I start to round the number of 
        root directory entries up to fill the last root directory 
        sector. Some utility programs can be confused if the last sector 
        is only partially used.

  /DEVICETYPE:n

        DOS does not care what type the device is, but in case some 
        utility program asks DOS for the type it can be specified with 
        this switch. This is normally set correctly if you use the /F 
        switch. Device types are

                0 = 360K
                1 = 1.2M
                2 = 720K
                3 = 8-inch single-density
                4 = 8-inch double-density
                5 = Hard disk
                6 = Tape drive
                7 = 1.44M
                8 = Read/Write optical
                9 = 2.88M

  /E /ENVIRONMENT

        Set environment variables SRDISK1, SRDISK2 etc. to the drive 
        letters or SRDISK drives installed. You can then use the 
        variables in batch files to access the RAM disk.

        For example:

                REM Set environment variables without much output and
                REM make a tiny disk at the same time
                SRDISK /E /V:1 /F:1
                SET TMP=%SRDISK1%:\TMP
                MKDIR %TMP%

                IF "%SRDISK2%" == "" ECHO You have only one SRDISK drive

  /F:n /DOSFORMAT:n

        DOS or FDFORMAT look-alike formats. The number n defines the disk 
        size in Kbytes. This option also sets all the other parameters 
        besides the size to match the corresponding DOS or FDFORMAT 
        created floppy disk.

        The currently supported formats are

        In addition to these there is a special format 1 to make a mini 
        disk. This can be used if you have your RAM disk in your PATH 
        and do not want to get Drive Not Ready errors when you have 
        freed the memory for RAM disk. Check your memory manager though: 
        some memory managers allocate memory in 16K chunks and a 1K disk 
        uses as much memory as a 16K disk does.

  /FILESPACE:n

        Space available for files. The disk will be larger than n 
        Kbytes, since file allocation table and root directory always 
        take some space too.

        Note that files usually take some extra space because the space 
        for them is allocated in clusters. For example, if cluster size 
        is 1024 bytes (1K), any file this long or smaller (but not 0 
        bytes) will use one cluster and thus 1024 bytes.

        Subdirectories also use file space.

  /FREEMEM:n /MAXSIZE

        Memory available for other programs. The disk will be sized to 
        leave at least n Kbytes of memory to other programs. The disk 
        size may be less than necessary if there is some uncertainty 
        whether or not all the memory can be allocated.

        FOR XMS MEMORY, THIS CAN ALLOCATE LESS THAN THERE IS AVAILABLE 
        SINCE XMS CAN NOT RELIABLY PUT ALL FREE MEMORY IN ONE BLOCK. 
        ALSO, SINCE SOME MEMORY MANAGERS ALLOCATE MEMORY IN BLOCKS OF 4 
        OR 16 KBYTES, THERE MIGHT BE 15 KBYTES LESS FREE MEMORY THAN 
        REQUESTED.

        The disk can also be disabled if more free memory is requested 
        than there is available.

        /MAXSIZE is same as /FREEMEM:0, thus using all safely available 
        memory for the disk.

        If some program of yours needs free memory and you do not care 
        for disk contents, you can put for example

                SRDISK /FREEMEM:1024 /YES

        into a batch file to start to program. The /YES gives permission 
        to clear the disk if the disk can not be made small enough 
        otherwise.

  /HEADS:n /SIDES:n

        Number of heads for DISKCOPY compatibility. This is normally set 
        correctly if you use the /F switch.

  /M:n[:n...]

        Max sizes for different drivers chained to a drive.

        Normally SRDISK uses as much space as is available on the first 
        driver and only then starts allocating on the second one. If you 
        want to use only up to some amount of memory on the different 
        drivers chained to one drive, you can define the amounts with 
        this option.

        For example to define first driver use only 100K of memory, give 
        command

                SRDISK /M:100

        If you would have three or more drivers chained into one drive, 
        you could define first and third to use 100K and let the other 
        drivers use as much as they were allowed to use before with 
        command

                SRDISK /M:100::100

  /MEDIA:n

        Media ID byte for DISKCOPY compatibility. This is normally set 
        correctly if you use the /F switch.

        Use Media IDs in the range from 0xF0 to 0xFF. Smaller values 
        make CHKDSK report that it is possibly non-DOS format media.

  /O /OLD

        Use old disk format where not explicitly redefined with command
        line options.

  /REMOVABLE:x

        This is for advanced users only. If you do not know all the 
        possible effects of this switch, you better leave it alone.

        This is provided to allow fooling programs which misbehave when 
        they see a removable RAM disk. If the x is ON, + or nothing, the 
        device driver reports the disk correctly as removable. If the x 
        is OFF or -, the device driver reports the disk not removable in 
        the same way RAMDRIVE does. It also prohibits SRDISK.EXE from 
        reformatting the disk.

  /S:n /SECTORSIZE:n

        Sector size (128, 256 or 512 bytes). Sector is the basic 
        allocation unit of a disk. Smaller sector size can decrease the 
        amount of memory wasted on boot sector, FAT and root directory, 
        but that is just about the only benefit of it. Clusters are 
        formed of sectors, so sector size can not be larger than cluster 
        size. DOS uses by default 512 bytes per sectors.

  /SECTORS:n /SPT:n

        Number of sectors per track for DISKCOPY compatibility. This is 
        normally set correctly if you use the /F switch.

  /U /UNCONDITIONAL /ERASE

        Clear disk contents. This implies option /YES.

        If your disk gets corrupted and SRDISK refuses to reformat it, 
        try this switch. SRDISK should not then care about the current 
        disk, but rather just wipes it off and creates a new one.

  /V:n /VERBOSE:n

        Verbose level (1-5) to control amount of output. With /V:1 you 
        can limit the output to the title.

  /W:x /WRITEPROTECT:x

        Write protection control. The parameter x can be ON, + or nothing 
        to enable the write protection or OFF or - to disable it.

  /Y /YES /FORCE
  /NO
  /ASK

        These are to control the need of user intervention.

        All questions in SRDISK are formed so that answer YES will give 
        permission to destroy data and continue, while NO will abort the 
        operation and try to preserve the data on the disk. By these 
        options you can give the answer on the command line.

        /ASK is the default and means the user will be prompted to make 
        choice.



                           6. TROUBLESHOOTING

Causes of grief

1. RAM disks loose their contents when power is turned off! Do not store
anything valuable there.

2. There is no XMS nor EMS memory without a proper device driver. 
HIMEM.SYS will do for XMS. For EMS you need to install the device driver 
that came with your expanded memory hardware. QEMM can supply both on 
386 or better hardware and you might be better off using the SRDEMS 
driver with it.

3. Not all HIMEM.SYS support memory above 16M limit. HIMEM.SYS versions 
2.78 and later should be good. Also these later versions may be limited
to 128000K blocks; solution is to link two (or more) SRDXMS.SYS drivers
(i.e. add "DEVICE=SRDXMS.SYS /A" line to CONFIG.SYS) and limit the first
one with command "SRDISK /M:128000". This will only break the /MAXSIZE
option.

4. Not all HIMEM.SYS support memory above 64M limit. You can try
XMSSIZE.EXE as a last resort solution after trying to find a working XMS
driver.

5. DR-DOS 5 HIDOS.SYS does not implement the XMS resize function.
Therefore SRDISK may not be able to resize the disk unless you replace 
the HIDOS.SYS with HIMEM.SYS.

6. Some programs swap themselves for a shell to the RAMDisk. If you
change the format of the disk or clear the disk from such program, the
swapped program may not be able to recover and can crash your computer.

7. Some disk caching programs are reported to cache SRDISK too! This can
cause a system crash and caching a RAM disk is anyway useless. If you 
use a disk cache, please load it before SRDxxx.SYS or tell it explicitly 
not to cache the SRDISK drive.

8. SRDISK needs it's XMS memory in one contiguous area. Therefore if
SRDISK complaints about insufficient memory while you have plenty of it 
free, the reason might be that some other program uses a piece of the
memory in the middle of the available memory. If you have a choice, use 
EMS since it does not (usually) have this problem.

9. There can be problems with XMS memory when not enough of it can be
allocated. This may result in lost disk contents. Also some memory 
managers that provide both XMS and EMS (like QEMM and the EMM386.EXE of 
MS-DOS 6) can fool SRDISK to think there is more memory available than 
there really is if SRDISK uses both XMS and EMS memory for the disk.

10. Some multitasking environments (like MS-Windows) can free the memory
allocated under them to the RAM disk. This will cause the data to be lost
and errors in programs that try to access the disk.

11. MS-Windows 3.x has buggy memory protection that prevents programs
from accessing memory allocated in another session. It also prevents
using EMS memory allocated for the SRDEMS.SYS driver outside Windows and
for the SRDEMS3.SYS driver inside Windows. In general you may find it
better to use SRDEMS3.SYS or SRDXMS.SYS and allocate any disk you will
use before starting Windows and never resize any disk while inside
Windows.  

12. Some programs try to access the disk directly thinking that it is
a floppy drive. Such attempts naturally fail. McAfee SCAN is one such
program, but you can disable the direct disk access with /NODDA option
to SCAN.



                7. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q: Why can not SRDISK resize automatically as files are written to the
   disk? Or why can not SRDISK allocate memory only as much as needed for
   the files?
A: SRDISK device driver is very stupid. It only reads and writes sectors,
   that is, blocks of data, as requested by DOS. The device driver does
   not know anything about files and directories. SRDISK with this
   functionality would not be SRDISK anymore. It would be much larger,
   somewhat slower and less reliable in some circumstances.

Q: Can you write a program that saves the disk contents on shutdown or
   periodically and restores it on startup?
A: Yes, but I find it unnecessary. I think disk caches can come close to
   what you are after. Also, there already is such a program, called
   ramsave, which works with all RAM disks. I only know how to find it
   on Internet: go to http://www.shareware.com/ and search for it.

Q: I have a CD-ROM/NET at drive D:, but now SRDISK wants to use D:. What
   now?
A: SRDISK is a block device driver and DOS, not SRDISK, selects the
   drive letter for the drive. CD-ROM is a file system and DOS allows it
   to choose it's own drive letter. You'd have this same problem with
   second hard disk or other block device. In my opinion, it is best to
   install CD-ROM at drive letter Z: so you do not run into this problem
   again. If you are fearless explorer, you can seek for some device
   driver loader. They go into DOS internals to set the drive letter
   while they install the device driver. They also tend to be unreliable
   and work with only few DOS versions.

Q: Why does Windows 95 slow down when I have SRDISK installed?
A: It does not recognize SRDISK and uses safer and slower disk access
   methods. To fix it, find file named IOS.INI in your Windows
   directory. Add in this file these lines (much the same way as there
   already is a line for ramdrive.sys)
     srdxms.sys, NON_DISK  ; MS-DOS  
     srdems.sys, NON_DISK  ; MS-DOS  
     srdxmss.sys, NON_DISK  ; MS-DOS 
     srdemss.sys, NON_DISK  ; MS-DOS 

Q: What is the latest version of SRDISK?
A: SRDISK has become quite stable. There are no new versions very often.
   However, check the answer to the next question below or email me.
   I'll be glad to tell you. My address is at the end of this document.

Q: Where can I find latest version of SRDISK?
A: The release site is at http://sourceforge.net/projects/srdisk.

Q: SRDISK does not work! What is the problem?
A: Give me more information. I need to know exactly what you have done
   and what results you get. Tell me your DOS manufacturer (MS, IBM,
   DR...), DOS version, hardware description with CPU type, amount of
   memory, memory manager software versions. Include CONFIG.SYS,
   AUTOEXEC.BAT, detailed chronological description of what you see on
   screen, what you type etc. The best is if I can get the problem
   appear on my PC.

Q:
A: I am kind of pleased this silence is so common. However, I live on
   feedback. Feed me. Do not keep silent.
