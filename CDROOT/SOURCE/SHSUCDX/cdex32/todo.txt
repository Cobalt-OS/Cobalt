/I option to override install check and install anyway? This would allow images
to be loaded from within Windows (which has its own MSCDEX).

Problem with XP setup on FreeDOS. Read problem? FreeDOS problem?

/S option to use D:\ via TRUENAME hook? Sharing (what does it do)?

Add a name cache?

Fix potential problem with copyright/abstract/bibliographic filenames?
  (Doesn't generate tilde, doesn't use Joliet.)

Critical sections?

SHSUCDHD: real-time decompression (LZO)?
(et al)   allow reads greater 62Ki?

Linux/dosemu locking?
Writing to hard drive whilst reading from CD? (Redirecting CDBENCH output.)

Multiple buffers/read-ahead?
 I tested MSCDEX v2.25 with default settings (/M:6?) and /M:1 (rounds to 4?),
 with SMARTDrive, and SHSUCDX 3.00 beta 1, with SMARTCDX. Two tests were
 done: bdiffing a 9M file against itself and dir/s/b on a CD with 5135
 files. The default MSCDEX bdiff was only slightly faster than /M:1 and
 SHSUCDX (3.30s versus 3.40s). The SHSUCDX dir/s/b was half the time of
 either MSCDEX (0.62s versus 1.24s). Thus, there doesn't seem to be any
 advantage to using multiple buffers.
