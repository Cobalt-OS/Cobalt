History

Legend:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Feature added
- Feature removed
* Bugfix
! Known Bug
# Internal change


XFDisk I Version 0.9.3 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* reduced Boot Manager size and moved to end of first head (n sectores/head ->
  CHS 0/0/n-13 upto 0/0/n). This should solve the problem with HighPoint/Abit
  IDE adapter cards


XFDisk I Version 0.9.2 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Boot Manager tried to boot from floppy after timeout if simple menue was
  activated
# extended INT13-BIOS-functions are only used if more than one additional
  cylinder is availble (hopefully helps to resolve problem with some old
  SCSI systems)


XFDisk I Version 0.9.1 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Partition Area can be erased completely at users choice
# /NOINIT switch dropped, functionality moved to menue
# /PQMAGIC switch dropped, it's now default mode
# /AUTOHIDE switch set to default in INI file
! XFDisk boot manager will be erased by OS/2 Warp 5 Server and BIOS saving
  of HighPoint/Abit IDE adapter cards, because they all use the same "free"
  area of the first hard disk
Changes in Build 318:
+ XFDisk checks if XFDisks MBR is installed when the Boot Manager is installed
+ XFDisk does not delete Partition Magics settings every time the Boot Manager
  is updated
* /PQMAGIC mode was inactive
Changes in Build 319:
* test of MBR corrected
* bug in progress bar corrected
Changes in Build 320:
* arithmetical overflow during initialization of large partitions fixed
Changes in Build 321:
+ Boot Manager: additional boot option (F2) added to boot from floppy but
  change partition table as booting selected partition before


XFDisk I Version 0.9.0 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ XFDisk now supports multiple visible primary partitions. In this mode
  the boot manager will not hide primary partitions any more. Using command
  line parameter /AUTOHIDE, XFDisk will act as before and allow only one
  visible primary partition per drive.
+ It is possible to install the boot manager without allowing XFDisk to
  do any changes in the partition table. Changes in the partition table
  can be allowed or rejected for each drive separatly.
+ XFDisk doens not change the order of existing partition table entries.
  Sorting can be forced by using parameter /SORT.
# The boot manager will be encrypted as in earlier versions to avoid
  Partition Magic using unused space for saving its configuration.
Changes to Alpha versions:
* Build 314: the boot manager now should again control the active flag of
  the partition table
+ Build 314: a wrong checksum of the boot manager will not cause XFDisk
  to deinstall it
* Build 315: fixed assignment of drive letters that caused a message of
  insufficent memory
* Build 316: unhiding a partition will only hide others in /AUTOHIDE mode


XFDisk I Version 0.8.5 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The Bootmanager just warns if the boot block was modified. This is useful
  because Partition Magic sometimes modifies an unused data area.


XFDisk I Version 0.8.4 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Command line parameters /NOWIN9X, /OS2, /WINNT and /LINUX added to allow
  control over default partition types used by XFDisk


XFDisk I Version 0.8.3 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Command line parameters can be set in the file XFDISK.INI
+ Command line parameter /PQMAGIC activates Power Quest Partition Magic
  compatibility
+ Implemented a menu for the most important partition types
+ Partitioning ad configuration can be saved to/loaded from a file
+ Implemented simple menus for the Bootmanager
+ The partition selected last time in the Bootmanager can be changed with
  XFDisk (together with "Remember choice" this makes possible the choice
  of the partition to boot without changing the entry number)
+ Master and partition password will be asked upon manipulating functions
  of XFDisk once per session
* The end of an extended partition will be determined by the last logical
  drive and not by the free space that is reserved for logical drives.
# Changed menu code
# Changed version scheme... again... ;-)


XFDisk I Version 0.8.2 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ new command line argument /NOINIT disables initialization of new partitions
  for recovery purposes
* free area within extended partitions caused wrong sized partition table
  entry


XFDisk I Version 0.8.1 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* logical partitions at the end of the disk were always marked as
  logical partitions with int13x support required
* corrected chaining within logical partitions with int13x
* corrected initialisation of logical partitions


XFDisk I Version 0.8.0 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Support for Harddisks >8 GB through extended INT13-BIOS-functions
* XFDisk crashed when the extended partition was empty
* If the extended partition started at cylinder 0, the partition sectors of
  the logical drives were corrupted
# Changed code to read the partition table
# Changed code to align new partitions

XFDisk I Version 0.7.0 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ The Bootmanager can now remeber the choice in the Boot Menu
* On activating a partition all other partitions on all other drives were
  deactivated
* Problems with not correctly initialised partitions should be solved
* Partitions larger than 2 GB will be FAT32 by default
# Changed code for writing to/reading from harddisk


XFDisk I Version 0.6.0 Beta EN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! XFDisk won't initialise new partitions correctly, so there may be problems
  using DOS format. This only happens when using large harddisks and creating
  partitions of other size at the place of a deleted partition.
! XFDisk won't work with harddisk with more than 1024 Cylinders. The limit for
  older BIOSes is 504 MB, for newer systems depending on the BIOS the limit is
  at 1008 MB, 2016 MB, 4032 MB or 8064 MB.
! The Bootmanager can't boot some Systems (like QNX or Solaris)

This is the first 'international' version of XFDisk.
