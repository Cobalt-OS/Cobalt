#
#  Waterloo TCP/IP sample configuration file.
#
#  Use this file as a template to make your own.
#  This file should be located in "current directory" or in a directory
#  pointed to by the environment variable "WATTCP.CFG".
#
#  This file is searched in the following directories until found:
#   1. via the environment variable "WATTCP.CFG".
#   2. in the directory of the executing program (if DOS 3+ used).
#   3. in the current directory.
#
#  E.g. Put a copy of this file in "c:\net\watt\bin" and insert this
#       line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT (or %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT):
#
#         SET WATTCP.CFG=C:\NET\WATT\BIN
#
#  Note 1: No trailing `\' at end of line, and no spaces around the `='.
#
#  Note 2: The order of keywords/value pairs are significant.
#    For instance, if you have "134.121.10.8 my_dns" in your
#    "c:\net\watt\bin\hosts" file, then "hosts = c:\net\watt\bin\hosts"
#    MUST be listed before the line specifying your nameserver;
#    "nameserver = my_dns".  The same rule applies to "gateway" and "cookie"
#
#  Note 3: the value (right of `=') is the default if you comment the
#    line out. Comments starts with `#' or `;'. To use `#' or `;' inside
#    string values, the string MUST be put in quotes.
#    E.g. these keywords have different values:
#      keyword1 = "hello world #;"
#      keyword2 = "hello world "#;
#
#  Note 4: The right-side value may contain an environment variable that
#    will be expanded when read. The effect is like in a Makefile.
#    E.g. if environment variable "ETC" is "c:\net\watt\bin",
#         "$(ETC)\hosts" becomes "c:\net\watt\bin\hosts" after
#         expansion.  See "README.TOO" for details.
#
#  Note 5: Remember that all this text takes time to parse (especially on
#    a 386 or older CPU). Cut down the contents of your "WATTCP.CFG" (not
#    this file, a copy) to a minimum to improve speed.
#

# has shown that some drivers may have problem receving traffic needed for

# These modes are supported:
#
#   1 = Turn receiver off (take care!)
#   2 = Direct, receive only traffic to this PC
#   3 = mode 2 + broadcast (default for IPv4)
#   4 = mode 3 + limited multicast

# Notes: DHCP/BOOTP servers may add additional nameservers to the one(s)
#        you specify here.
#        There are no default server.  There can be a total of 10
#        nameservers. All nameserver are queried in sequence until an

#
# Notes: Will most likely be overridden by DHCP/BOOTP server.

#
# gateway = 0.0.0.0  ; mandatory if not using BOOTP/DHCP

#
# The Internet Domain Name of your network (of which your subnet is
# part of). The "Fully Qualified Domain Name" (FQDN) of your host is
# hostname + domain_list. E.g. "random-pc.your.domain.com".
#
# Note: "domain_list" (or previously named "domainslist") is used by DNS
#       to resolve "dot-less names" (i.e. no `.' in host-name) recursively.
#       E.g. resolving "random-pc2" will query all DNS-servers for these
#            names until an IP-address is found:
#              "random-pc2.your.domain.com"
#              "random-pc2.domain.com"
#              "random-pc2.com"
#              "random-pc2"
#
#       This behaviour can be turned off with "domain_recurse = 0"

# Note: domain_list may be overridden by DHCP server.
#       Max 50 characters.

# The penalty for using this option is a small delay since your assigned
# IP-address (MY_IP) must be reverse resolved into a Fully Qualified
# Domain Name (FQDN).
#
# Note: The use of this option will cause any HOSTNAME or DOMAIN_LIST to
#       be over-written. Any hostname or domainname coming from BOOTP or

# TFTP client configuration.
#
# To actually enable loading of `tftp.boot_file' via TFTP protocol,
# the application must supply a "writer" hook through function pointer
# `tftp_writer'. See <tcp.h> or .\src\tftp.c.
#
# The TFTP client uses UDP on port 69 (unless specified differently in
# $(ETC)\services).
#
# Note: When using DHCP (TFTP options and BOOTP not supported), the
#       "tftp.boot_file" and "tftp.server" specified below *may* be
#       overridden by the DHCP-server. This is because a properly
#       configured DHCP-server should know what's best for you...
#
# Specify what file to load. This file may be present in an option
# coming from DHCP-server, but can be specified here.
#
# Note: remote file-name is server's file-name (relative to it's virtual
#       root) and may contain a path. It's the responsibility of the
#       application to map server's boot filename into your local file
#       system or create any missing directories.
#
# The format of "tftp.boot_file" is "remote name" optionally followed by a
# local name. E.g. "tftp.boot_file = /tftpd/bootp.file $(TEMP)\bootp.fil"
#
# Note: The remote/local filenames cannot contain any spaces or tabs.
#
tftp.boot_file = ; optional

#
# Specify what server (dotted ip-address or host from `hosts' file) to
# get TFTP.BOOT_FILE from. If not specified here, TFTP-server name MUST
# be given by DHCP server.
#
tftp.server = ; optional

#
# Specify timeout (in seconds) waiting for each packet from TFTP-server.
#
tftp.timeout = 8 ; optional

#
# Specify retry count waiting for packets from TFTP-server.
#
tftp.retry = 5 ; optional

#
# C-style open mode for the local file "tftp.boot_file".
# Specify "wt" to transfer a text file from a Unix-based TFTP server.
#
tftp.openmode = "wb"  ; default

#
# Specify transfer mode for retrieval. Either use "octet" (default) for
# 8-bit raw data, "netascii" or "mail". Ref. RFC-1350.
#
# Note: Some tftp servers (e.g. PumpKIN) ignores this mode.
#
tftp.mode = "octet" ; optional

#
# Specify local port to use. Default behaviour (0) is to select a random
# local port in range 1024 - 65535. If e.g. a firewall makes this
# difficult, use a fixed port above 1024.
